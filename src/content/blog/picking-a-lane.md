i thought i'd spend this period building things. surprisingly, a lot of it has been about forced introspection.

i'd been picking up and putting down projects, each one feeling short-sighted in a way i couldn't name. the market prefers clean labels: designer, marketer, engineer. do i want to be a designer or a marketer? should i lean in and be a design engineer? (god, pick a lane, Charmayne!)

of course i was struggling. i was trying to answer a personal question through a professional label. in hindsight, it seems obvious that you have to do the harder, quieter work of figuring out what you actually want before you can communicate it to the world.

when people ask me why i left product design for marketing, i usually say that i wanted to be "closer to the business". it's a reductive answer, yes. what i really mean is that i wanted a fuller relationship to the work i was doing.

i moved toward marketing, partly because i wanted distribution knowledge, partly because i thought that "closer to the business" meant "closer to the decisions."

some of this touches on questions about [designers, decisions, and influence](https://substack.com/home/post/p-142227619). in my specific context, it simply felt like there were pieces missing in the whole arc of things i wanted to be able to do.

marketing, at the time, seemed like it might close the gap. and it gave me something real: distribution confidence, the knowledge that i can take something to market.

design, on the other hand, has given me the ability to create something beautiful from nothing. (i've always loved making beautiful things.)

both curiosities were real and both are mine. together, they pointed toward the same destination of ownership and agency. neither, on its own, was the thing i was actually after.

on a macro level, roles are just a form of resource optimisation: shorthand for who does what best in a company. i first needed to define for myself what i want next — and then see roles as a helpful *constraint*; something that could channel my focus for a few years, and help me compound who i already am and the kind of impact i want to make.

it took me a while to name what i was after. but when i put together:

1. what i imagine my best future work looks like,
2. the kind of work i drift toward naturally, and
3. what i want people to come to me for,

the roles fall away, and i'm left with what i'm unwilling to give up: **end-to-end ownership over meaningful, human work**.

i want to be someone who can conceive, build, and bring meaningful things into the world — with enough autonomy to decide, enough craft to care, and enough stability to sustain myself.

the thing i'm building toward doesn't have a single job title, and that's ok.
